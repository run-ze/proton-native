# Packaging

Currently, through generous work of the `electron-builder` team, we have a packager for Mac, Linux and Windows.
`create-proton-app` exposes this functionality already.

To build your app: `npm run build`.

To bundle it: `npm run dist`.

For more advanced configuration, see the [electron-builder docs](https://www.electron.build/)
